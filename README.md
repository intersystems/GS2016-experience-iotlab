The Internet of Things opens up a whole new world of business opportunities. In this experience, you will use Ensemble and its new Java Business Hosts to connect data produced by an IoT device with business processes and workflows. Live data will be available from an IoT device and Ensemble will be used to trigger events on that device. Ultimately, you will visualize data captured throughout the experience on your mobile device or in a web browser.
For this experience, you will use your laptop to work with a container that provides you with your own InterSystems Ensemble environment. There is no need to install anything locally. This guide gives detailed step-by-step instructions to work through the IoT experience.
